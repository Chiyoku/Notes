# Category
A category is simply a group of objects and arrows between them. 
- Arrows are called *morphisms* and are like functions.
- *Composition* is just like joining two functions. If i have something like $g \circ f$, it is read as *g after f*. Composition is right associative so $h \circ g \circ f$ should be read as $h \circ (g \circ f)$
- *Identity function*  an useful function that express a function that does nothing and it's useful when working with symbolic variables.
